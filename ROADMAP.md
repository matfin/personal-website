# Tech Roadmap
This is what we need to do to build a nice, simple, well maintained application.

## What we have
- full test coverage and reporting
- code splitting and separate bundle configuration for webpack
- code lint tools
- basic REST server to serve assets and content
- better path aliasing for module imports
- server side rendering with caching
- progressive web app with offline capability
- improved Lighthouse audit scores
- animated UI to communicate flow effectively to the user
- production bundling and CI flow with CircleCI and Docker

## Nice to have
- use Redux Saga
- use Storybook for component rendering/documentation
- error boundary for better error handling

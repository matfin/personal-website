# Tech Roadmap

This is what we need to do to build a nice, simple, well maintained application.

## What we have

- full test coverage and reporting
- bundling with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
- code lint tools
- better path aliasing for module imports
- static site generation
- improved Lighthouse audit scores
- animated UI to communicate flow effectively to the user
- production bundling and CI flow
- use Redux ToolKit

## Nice to have

- use Storybook for component rendering/documentation
- error boundary for better error handling
- progressive web app with offline capability
- md file describing the architectural overview, which needs to be rewritten

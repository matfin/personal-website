Trying to implement pinch and zoom was not going to work, despite best efforts. In the end, a native wrapper for displaying images was created for iOS and Android, which allowed for a much smoother user experience in viewing images."

The Sencha storage mechanism (which leveraged the use of LocalStorage) could have been used, but if a user chose to clear their browser cache on their device, it would wipe out the content for the app, which would then need to be uninstalled and reinstalled. To counter this, it was decided that the content would be bundled with the application itself and loaded locally. Content would need to be accessible while the device was potentially offline."

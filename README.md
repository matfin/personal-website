## Personal portfolio and CV

This is my personal website which acts as my portfolio and CV / Resum√©.

My motivation in creating this was to gain a deeper understanding of modern web development practices. I use it as a testing ground for exploring modern web development practices and technologies.

### What does this project encompass?

- dependency management with [yarn](https://webpack.js.org/) and building with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which is a superset of JavaScript and includes strict type-checking.

- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) and [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) which is what I use to unit tests components.

- [Docker / Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is used to test builds locally before I upload them. I have a self signed SSL cert so I can use HTTPS locally, which I created with the help of this [excellent guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-https-working-on-your-local-development-environment-in-5-minutes-7af615770eec/).

- I implemented a content rendering engine that reads in a tree of items from JSON files, then chooses the correct component to render as the JSON is fetched.

- For state management, I use [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/). This makes managing complex async functionality much easier and readable.

### How to install and run this

To get this running, you should have an up to date stable version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). I am using `20.12.2`. You should also have the most up to date version of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed globally.

- `$ git@github.com:matfin/personal-website.git` to clone this to your local machine
- `$ cd personal-website/`
- `$ yarn` will install dependencies
- `$ yarn start` will build the server and client and watch for changes
- `$ yarn deploy` will generate the site as a static bundle, which is output to the `/dist` directory.
- `$ yarn checks` will run unit tests with coverage, code lint and style lint.

### Where does this run?

On all modern web browsers both mobile and desktop. Internet Explorer is not supported.

### How is this deployed?

For CI (continuous integration), a very popular and well documented tool called [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) is used.

I have a script that generates all content and assets, then a CircleCI config that deploys this to a remote server.

### What are the nice to haves?

I have documented these in the [Tech Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and will keep working on them.

## Personal portfolio and CV
As the title says, this is my personal website which acts as my portfolio and CV / Resum√©;

My motivation in creating this was to gain a deeper understanding of modern web development practices.

### What does this project encompass?
- dependency management with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), including code splitting and bundling.

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which is a superset of JavaScript and includes strict type-checking.

- [Progressive Web Apps](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) which allows for caching and offline viewing.

- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) which is what I use to unit tests components. 

- Static site generation. I wrote a script to generate static HTML for all pages so they can be served statically alongside assets. A bundles JS file rehydrates everything on load. 

- [Docker / Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is used to test builds locally before I upload them. I have a self signed SSL cert so I can use HTTPS locally, which I created with the help of this [excellent guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-https-working-on-your-local-development-environment-in-5-minutes-7af615770eec/).

- I implemented a content rendering engine that reads in a tree of items from JSON files, then chooses the correct component to render as the JSON is fetched.

- For state management, I use Redux/Saga. This makes managing complex async functionality much easier and readable.

### How to install and run this
To get this running, you should have an up to date stable version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). I am using `12.16`. You should also have the most up to date version of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed globally.

- `$ git@github.com:matfin/personal-website.git` to clone this to your local machine
- `$ cd personal-website/`
- `$ yarn` will install dependencies
- `$ yarn dev` will build the server and client and watch for changes
- `$ yarn deploy` will generate the site as a static bundle, which is output to the `/out` directory.

### Where does this run?
On all modern web browsers both mobile and desktop even with offline capability (with service workers). Internet Explorer is not supported.

### How is this deployed?
For CI (continuous integration), a very popular and well documented tool called [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) is used.

I have a script that generates all content and assets, then a CircleCI config that deploys this to a remote server.

### What are the nice to haves?
I have documented these in the [Tech Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and will keep working on them.
